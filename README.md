## START

Simply run the image

```
sh start.sh
```

## NOTES

 * Simply add `ssh/authorized_keys` file and add public key there
 * Start using `start.sh`
 * By default `start.sh` will make SSH listen on port `2211` - you can change it in the script
 * Update `IP` and `PORT` variables in `test.sh` and run it to ensure it works
